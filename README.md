# hello-world
Just the beginning!
I studied one year of Civil Engineering, but in my first C class I already knew I would not keep studying this major. After one year I dropped out university and applied to MIT, right now I am doing the MITOCW courses of computer science (6. courses ...). I am learning all the things in Python for now.
